# CampoMinado-prompt-
My first code in C++ (Programmed in 01/06/2017)

The number of bombs and size of field can vary and be adjusted on the .cpp file.
To play the game run .cpp in the console and write the coordinate when "Write the coordinate:" appear.
The notation to write the coordinate must be "XX XX", where XX is the number. If less than 10 write 01 for example.

It is possible to make a mark on the field to remember where there are bombs. To do this write b after the coordinate. Example: "XX XX b".
(The coordinate will be marked as red)

This code was made in portuguese.
