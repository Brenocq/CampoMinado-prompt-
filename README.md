# CampoMinado-prompt-
My first code in C++ (Programmed in 01/06/2017)

The number of bombs and size of field can vary and be adjusted on the .cpp file.
To play the game run the .exe file and write the coordinate when "Digite sua localização:" appear.
The notation to write the coordinate must be "XX XX", where XX is the number. If less than 10 write 01 for example.

It is possible to make a mark on the field to remember where there are bombs. To do this write b after the coordinate. Example: "XX XX b".

This code was made em portuguese.
